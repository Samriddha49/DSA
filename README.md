A matrix is a two-dimensional data object made of m rows and n columns, therefore having total m x n values. If most of the elements of the matrix have 0 value, then it is called a sparse matrix.
Total elements of the given matrix is m*n. So if Total number of Non-Zero elements/(m*n) <= 0.5, then the matrix is called Sparse Matrix.
